📊 Numpy Crash Course

🟢 Status:
Completed basic Numpy crash course and practice problems.

💡 Purpose:
This folder contains my Numpy learning journey. The goal was to quickly and effectively understand the essentials of Numpy, a foundational Python library for numerical computing and data manipulation.

🎯 What I did:
Learned the basics: arrays, matrix manipulations, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and random number generation.
Practiced common operations like dot product, reshaping, masking, and custom matrix generation.
Focused on preparing this skill as part of my Machine Learning & Data Science prep for GSoC 2025.

🔥 Why:
Numpy is a core building block for all ML/AI projects.
Essential for working with Pandas, Matplotlib, and libraries like Scikit-learn later.
Preparing strong fundamentals for open-source contributions and GSoC proposal writing.

⚠️ Honest Note:
I’m currently on a fast-track plan to build my ML skills for GSoC, so this is part of my rapid upskilling sprint. 🚀 I'm keeping it lean, focused, and real! 💪

🚀 Next Step:
Move to Pandas Crash Course.
