📊 Numpy Crash Course

🎯 What I did:
Learned the basics: arrays, matrix manipulations, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and random number generation.
Practiced common operations like dot product, reshaping, masking, and custom matrix generation.
Focused on preparing this skill as part of my Machine Learning & Data Science prep for GSoC 2025.

⚠️ Honest Note:
I’m currently on a fast-track plan to build my ML skills for GSoC, so this is part of my rapid upskilling sprint. 🚀 I'm keeping it lean, focused, and real! 💪

🚀 Next Step:
Move to Pandas Crash Course.
